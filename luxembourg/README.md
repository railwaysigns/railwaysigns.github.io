Railway signalling in Luxembourg
================================

Introduction
------------

In Luxembourg, trains run on the right-hand side, so the signals are placed on this side of the tracks. An exception is line 5, where the trains run on the left side. When the signals are placed on the left, a plate with an arrow points to the track affected by the signal. There are two signal screens: a so-called "classic" signal screen with a black area surrounded by a white border, and a compact screen without this border. The compact screen is used in more recent installations, and its appearance is more reminiscent of the German signals. In accordance with convention, the tables in this document show the compact format on the left and the standard format on the right.

The signalling works in conjunction with the European Train Control System Level 1 (ETCS L1), which has replaced the speed control system Memor II+ derived from the Belgian Memor, which was discontinued at the end of 2019.

The Luxembourg signalling system is based on the German approach signal/main signal principle, and assigns a code to each signal and signal aspect. On the other hand, it incorporates various elements of the French signal system: Two yellow lights to signal the crossing of a switch at reduced speed (instead of the German combination of green and yellow light), the use of the Crocodile together with Memor II+, and the use of boards indicating electric traction.

There are four types of light signals:
- the _main signal (Signal fixe principal / SFP)_, which regulates the traffic flow,
- the _distant signal (Signal fixe avancé / SFAv)_, which announces the aspect of the next main signal,
- the _repeated distant signal (Signal fixe avancé répétiteur / SFAvR))_, which repeats the last distant signal and is only placed if the main signal isn't visible from a certain distance, and
- the _shunting signal (Signal fixe de voie barrée / SFVb)_, which is a signal used to control shunting movements.

The SFP and SFVb signals can be combined, in this case the main signal is referred to as main signal with shunting signal (SFPVb) . Similarly, the main and distant signals can be fixed on the same mast.

If a signal or sign must not be taken into account, even when lit, it is covered by a Saint Andrew's cross (RM14: Cancellation marker for fixed signals out of order) which also cancels the complementary signals; if several signals are placed on a mast, only the one or those covered by a cross are cancelled.

Light signals
-------------

The light signals are designed and arranged to be visible from a distance. For this purpose, they are equipped with lenses to focus the light rays emitted by the light bulb, which can be selected at a reasonable power. For this reason, the lights do not appear to be very bright when viewed from the side when they illuminate violently in the normal axis of vision, i.e., in the direction of train arrival.

### Marker plates

Each light signal has a marker plate, which makes it possible to identify, even when switched off, which signal it is. This section also presents other very important tracking signals.

|Aspect|Explanation|
|:----:|:----------|
|![Chevron][RF1]|**RF1 - Chevron:** Marks the beginning of the reduced speed zone indicated by the main signal in position 3.|
|![Distant signal plate or substitution plate][RF3]|**RF3 - Distant signal plate or substitution plate:** Marks a distant signal or substitutes it completely. In the latter case, it indicates the braking distance being 400m.|
|![Mirlitons][RF4]|**RF4 - Mirlitons:** Based on the principle of the SNCF's Mirlitons; a first mirliton (1 bar) is placed 100 metres from the signal, preceded by one or two mirlitons (2 or 3 bars) spaced 75 metres apart. A square format exists for installations in confined spaces.|
|![Plate marking main signals that command to stop when they are unduly extinguished][RF7]|**RF7 - Plate marking main signals that command to stop when they are unduly extinguished:** The marker differs depending on whether it is a main fixed signal (left) or a fixed signal of a blocked track or a combination of both (right).|

### Distant signals

The advanced fixed signal is used to announce the status of the following main signal, thus allowing the driver to adapt the train's operation.
If the speed limit of a line is less than 50 km/h, these signals are not implemented: only the table for locating or substituting the distant signals is then present.

|Aspect|Explanation|
|:----:|:----------|
|![SFAv Position 1][SFAv_P1]|**SFAv Position 1:** The amber light announces that the next signal is not passable (red light). If the signal is switched off, it is to be considered as displaying this aspect.|
|![SFAv Position 2][SFAv_P2]|**SFAv Position 2:** The green light announces that the next signal is passable (green light).|
|![SFAv Position 3][SFAv_P3]|**SFAv Position 3:** The double amber light announces that the next signal is passable at reduced speed (double amber light), regularly at 40 km/h.|

### Repeated distant signals

The distant signal can be repeated if necessary. If the speed limit of a line is less than 50 km/h, these signals are not be implemented.

|Aspect|Explanation|
|:----:|:----------|
|![SFAvR Position 1][SFAvR_P1]|**SFAvR Position 1:** Repeats position 1. If the signal is switched off, it is to be considered as displaying this aspect.|
|![SFAvR Position 2][SFAvR_P2]|**SFAvR Position 2:** Repeats Position 2.|
|![SFAvR Position 3][SFAvR_P3]|**SFAvR Position 3:** Repeats Position 3.|

### Main Signals

The main signal protects e.g. a block or a switch.

|Aspect|Explanation|
|:----:|:----------|
|![SFP Position 1][SFP_P1]|**SFP Position 1:** Absolute stop. If the signal is switched off, it should be considered as displaying this aspect.|
|![SFP Position 2][SFP_P2]|**SFP Position 2:** All clear.|
|![SFP Position 3][SFP_P3]|**SFP Position 3:** Crossing switches at a reduced speed of 40 km/h as a general rule; speed to be applied from the chevron (RF1) to the next signal or speedometer.|

### Shunting signals

The shunting signal is used to control trains during shunting operations or to protect a track or station where several trains may enter. These lights can also be placed horizontally, with the blue light on the left and the white light on the right.

|Aspect|Explanation|
|:----:|:----------|
|![SFVb Position][SFVb_P1]|**SFVb Position 1:** Stop for shunting trains. If the signal is switched off, it can only be passed with a verbal command.|
|![SFVb Position][SFVb_P2]|**SFVb Position 2:** Clear track for shunting trains.|

### Main signals with shunting signals

Main signals and shunting signals can be combined, mainly at station entrances or exits.

|Aspect|Explanation|
|:----:|:----------|
|![SFP Position 1][SFPVb_P1]|**SFP Position 1:** Absolute stop for trains.|
|![SFPVb Position 2][SFPVb_P2]|**SFPVb Position 2:** Clear track for shunting trains, absolute stop for other trains.|
|![SFP Position 2][SFPVb_P3]|**SFP Position 2:** All clear.|
|![SFP Position 3][SFPVb_P4]|**SFP Position 3:** Crossing switches at a reduced speed of 40 km/h as a general rule; speed to be applied from the chevron (RF1) to the next signal or speedometer.|

### Additional light signals

These light signals are coupled to a distant, repeated distant or main signal displaying position 3, announcing passing or the passing of a switch at reduced speed with two amber lights.

At distant signals, the indicator is placed under the signal and displays in yellow, at main signals it is placed above the signal, except for reverse indications which are placed under the signals and display in white (and are not pre-announced). These different indicators can be coupled together: speed + dead end or speed + reverse direction.

|Aspect|Explanation|
|:----:|:----------|
|![SFAvVo][SFAv-Vo]|**SFAvVo - Distant reception signal on dead-end track, on occupied track or on track not usable over its entire length:** Announces the SFVo signal.|
|![SFVo][SF-Vo]|**SFVo - Reception signal on dead-end track, on occupied track or on track not usable over its entire length:** The speed is limited to 25 km/h when passing the "Imp" sign or at the beginning of the platform.|
|![SFAvI][SA-vI]|**SFAvI - Distant Signal Speed Indicator:** Announces the SFI signal.|
|![SFI][SF-I]|**SFI - Speed indicator signal:** This signal indicates the speed at which the signal is passed (e.g. 7 = 70 km/h); if no indication is given, it is 40 km/h. The speedometer placed alone, without any other signal (SFI/R: Speed indicator signal/Resumption) marks the end of the reduced speed zone displayed by the previous signal and the beginning of a new zone at a different speed, until the next signal indicating a speed.|
|![SFCCI/O][SFCCIO]|**SFCCI/O - Change signal / origin board:** Announces to the driver the start of a section in the opposite direction.|
|![SFCCI/TF][SFCCITF]|**SFCCI/TF - Change signal / end board:** Announces to the driver the end of a section in the opposite direction.|
|![RF9][RF9]|**RF9: "Dead end" board:** Indicates that the track is at a dead end.|
